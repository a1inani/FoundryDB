# FoundryDB Brand Guidelines

## Name

**FoundryDB**

Capitalization rules:

- F and D are uppercase
- no space between “Foundry” and “DB”
- not “Foundry Db”, not “Foundry DB”, not “foundrydb”

## Brand Color

| name | hex |
|---|---|
| Foundry Orange | `#E65100` |

This is the primary colour used for icons and product identity.

## Logo System

There are three official logo assets:

| asset | purpose |
|---|---|
| **Icon** (hammer + DB + anvil, no text) | GitHub org avatar, file icons, tooling |
| **Banner** (logo + “FoundryDB” text)     | README header, docs landing page |
| **Favicon** (anvil silhouette only)      | browser tab, small UI badges |

### usage rules

- the icon and banner **must** remain Foundry Orange on transparent background
- the favicon should always be used at 256×256 or below
- do not stretch, distort, colour-shift or put borders around any logo

### clear space

Keep at least **1/3 of icon height** free around all sides when placing on backgrounds.

Example:

[ space ][ ICON ][ space ]


## Backgrounds

Logos are designed for **transparent backgrounds**.

When placing on a tinted background, ensure it is sufficiently dark or light for accessibility.

Prefer:

- white
- very pale greys
- **deep charcoal** (almost black) looks excellent with Foundry Orange
